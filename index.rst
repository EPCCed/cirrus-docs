Cirrus
======

Cirrus is a HPC and data science service hosted and run by `EPCC <http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`_ at
`The University of Edinburgh <http://www.ed.ac.uk>`_. It is one of the `EPSRC <http://www.epsrc.ac.uk>`_
Tier-2 National HPC Services.

Cirrus is available to industry and academic researchers. For information on how
to get access to the system please see the `Cirrus website <http://www.cirrus.ac.uk>`_.

The Cirrus facility is based around an SGI ICE XA system. There are 280 standard
compute nodes and 38 GPU compute nodes. Each standard compute node has 256 GiB of memory and
contains two 2.1 GHz, 18-core Intel Xeon (Broadwell) processors. Each GPU compute node has 384 GiB of 
memory, contains two 2.4 GHx, 20-core Intel Xeon (Cascade Lake) processors and four NVIDIA Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB
(Volta) GPU accelerators connected to the host processors and each other via PCIe. All nodes are
connected using a single Infiniband fabric and access the shared, 406 TiB Lustre file system.

This documentation covers:

* Cirrus User Guide: general information on how to use Cirrus
* Software Applications: notes on using specific software applications on Cirrus
* Software Libraries: notes on compiling against specific libraries on Cirrus. Most
  libraries work *as expected* so no additional notes are required however a small number require specific
  documentation
* Software Tools: Information on using tools such as debuggers and profilers on Cirrus

Information on using the SAFE web interface for managing and reporting on your usage on
Cirrus can be found on the `Tier-2 SAFE Documentation <http://tier2-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

This documentation draws on the `Sheffield Iceberg Documentation <https://github.com/rcgsheffield/sheffield_hpc>`__
and the documentation for the `ARCHER National Supercomputing Service <http://www.archer.ac.uk>`__.
