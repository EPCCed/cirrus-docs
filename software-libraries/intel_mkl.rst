Intel MKL: BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK
==================================

The Intel Maths Kernel Libraries (MKL) contain a variety of optimised
numerical libraries  including BLAS, LAPACK, and ScaLAPACK. In general,
the exact commands required to build against MKL depend on the details
of compiler, environment, requirements for parallelism, and so on. The
Intel MKL link line advisor should be consulted.

See
https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor.html

Some examples are given below. Note that loading the appropriate intel
tools module will provide the environment variable `MKLROOT` which holds
the location of the various MKL components.

Intel Compilers
---------------

BLAS and LAPACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use MKL libraries with the Intel compilers you just need to load the Intel
tools module:

::

   module load intel-tools-19

To include MKL you specify the ``-mkl`` option on your compile and link lines.
For example, to compile a single source file, Fortran program with MKL you could use:

::

   ifort -c -mkl -o lapack_prb.o lapack_prb.f90
   ifort -mkl -o lapack_prb.x lapack_prb.o

The ``-mkl`` flag without any options builds against the threaded version of MKL.
If you wish to build against the serial version of MKL, you would use
``-mkl=sequential``.

ScaLAPACK
~~~~~~~~~

The distributed memory linear algebra routines in ScaLAPACK require MPI in
addition to the compilers and MKL libraries. Here we use Intel MPI via:

::

   module load intel-tools-19
   module load intel-mpi-19

ScaLAPACK requires the Intel versions of BLACS at link time in addition to
ScaLAPACK libraries; remember also to use the MPI versions
of the compilers:

::

   mpiifort -c -o linsolve.o linsolve.f90
   mpiifort -o linsolve.x linsolve.o -L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64 -lpthread -lm -ldl


GNU Compiler
------------


BLAS and LAPACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use MKL libraries with the GNU compiler you first need to load the GNU
compiler module and Intel MKL module:

::

   module load gcc
   module load intel-cmkl-19

To include MKL you need to link explicitly against the MKL libraries.
For example, to compile a single source file Fortran program with MKL you
could use:

::

   gfortran -c -o lapack_prb.o lapack_prb.f90
   gfortran -o lapack_prb.x lapack_prb.o -L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64 -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_sequential

This will build against the serial version of MKL; to build against the threaded version use:

::

   gfortran -c -o lapack_prb.o lapack_prb.f90
   gfortran -fopenmp -o lapack_prb.x lapack_prb.o -L$MKLROOT/lib/intel64 -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_gnu_thread


ScaLAPACK
~~~~~~~~~

The distributed memory linear algebra routines in ScaLAPACK require MPI in
addition to the MKL libraries. On Cirrus, this is usually
provided by SGI MPT.

::

   module load gcc
   module load intel-cmkl-19
   module load mpt

Once you have the modules loaded you need to link against two additional
libraries to include ScaLAPACK. Note we use here the relevant
``mkl_blacs_sgimpt_lp64`` version of the BLACS library.
Remember to use the MPI versions of the compilers:

::

   mpif90 -f90=gfortran -c -o linsolve.o linsolve.f90
   mpif90 -f90=gfortran -o linsolve.x linsolve.o -L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lmkl_blacs_sgimpt_lp64 -lpthread -lm -ldl


ILP vs LP interface layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most applications will use 32-bit (4-byte) integers. This means the MKL
32-bit integer inteface should be selected (which gives the ``_lp64``
extensions seen in the examples above).

For applications which require, e.g., very large array indices
(greater than 2^31-1 elements), the 64-bit integer interface is
required. This gives rise to ``_ilp64`` appended to library names. 
This may also require ``-DMKL_ILP64`` at the compilation stage.
Check the Intel link line advisor for specific cases.
