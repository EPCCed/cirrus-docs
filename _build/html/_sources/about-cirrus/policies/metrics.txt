Policy for User Queries
=======================

This page describes the level of service we expect to meet with regards
to User Queries and Requests. There are a few different catorgories of
queries:

-  SP : Service Provision
-  CSE: Computational Science and Enginneering Queries
-  Technical Assessments for Grant and RAP Applications
-  Request for Changes

Service Provision Queries
-------------------------

Most of these queries should be straighforward to deal with. They can
include user account creation, setting new disk quotas or creation of
new projects.

We aim to complete at least 97% of all queries submitted within 48
working hours.

Computational Science and Engineering Queries
---------------------------------------------

These queries tend to be more involved and indepth queries. They can
include compilation or runtime issues.

Once a query has been classified as an indepth query, the helpdesk team
will respond to the user with an estimate of how long they think the
query will take to resolve.

We aim to complete at least 97% of all indepth queries within 16 weeks.

Technical Assessments
---------------------

The CSE team complete Technical Assessment for the various access routes
to Cirrus.

We aim to complete these within 10 working days of receipt.

Request for Changes
-------------------

We welcome Request for Changes from users which can include a change of
policy or configuration. We give consideration to all requests and
fulfil them if possible.

There is no time metric associated with this as it may require a
maintenance session to fulfil the request or wider discussion with other
users.
