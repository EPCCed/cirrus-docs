to use within the specified time period. Period allocations are valid
for a specific resource pool (machine) and have definitive start and end
dates. When the end date of the period allocation passes, any leftover

<h3>How can I administer time within my project?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-administer-time-within-my-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Time is measured in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/access/au-calculator/">*allocation
units*</a> (kAUs), and is
held in <em>budgets</em>. Every project group has its own budget. There are
always at least two project groups in your project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>general group</em>, which has the same code as the project itself.
Every member of the project is a member of this group, so the time in
its budget is available to them all.</li>
<li>The <em>reserve</em> project group, which has a name of form <em>t01-reserve</em>.
It has no members, so no one can use the time in its budget. This
budget can be used to hold time which the PI or project manager
wishes to hold in reserve for later use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, all your time is in the general group&#8217;s budget. If you are
happy with all your users using the same budget, you can leave things as
they are.</p>
<p>If you wish to divide the time up between groups, you can <a class="reference external" href="#projgrp">create a
project group</a> for each group. In this case you will
probably want to move all the time out the general group, since this can
be used by everyone.</p>
<p>You may wish to <a class="reference external" href="#oneuser">give time just to a single user</a>. This is
a special case of a project group: one with only one member.</p>
<p>The reserve budget is provided so that if you wish you can control the
use of time by your project members: you can keep most of the time in
your reserve budget, and move it to the other budgets as required. We
recommend that you should do this, even if you don&#8217;t need to create
other project groups.</p>

<h3>` &lt;&gt;`__ How can I allocate time to a single user?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-allocate-time-to-a-single-user" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As all the time in a project group is shared by all its members, the
only way to reserve some time for a single user is to create a project
group for that user alone.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="#projgrp">Create a new project group</a> for the user. For example,
if we are in project <em>t01</em> and the user is <em>fred</em>, you might call the

<li><a class="reference external" href="#mvtime">Move the time</a> you wish the user to have into the new
project group</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that time in the general group&#8217;s budget is accessible to all,
so you will probably want to move all of the project&#8217;s time away from
there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-i-administer-disk-space">
<h3>How can I administer disk space?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-administer-disk-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Start by reading the discussion of the <a class="reference external" href="#time">administration of
time</a>, as the administration of disk space is related to this,
and is also done using project groups. The two project groups which
exist in each project can also be used for administering space.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>general group</em>, which has the same code as the project itself,
includes every member of the project. The disk quotas of this project
group can therefore be used by them all.</li>
<li>The <em>reserve</em> project group, which has a name of form <em>t01-reserve</em>,
has no members, so no one can use the disk space which is in its
quotas. You can use these quotas to hold space which you want to hold
in reserve for later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Homespace and workspace are administered separately. A project has an
overall limit for each of these. Within that limit, every portion of
space must belong to one or other of the project group quotas. Thus, to
start with, all the homespace (for example) allocated to a project is
either in the general homespace quota or the reserve homespace quota.
Space never belongs to more than one group quota. [The reserve quota is
not a real quota, in fact. It has no existence on the service
machine—just in the database.]</p>
<p>Beyond the general and reserve quotas, you can also have quotas for the
project groups which you create. But this is not compulsory. If you&#8217;re
thinking about using project group quotas, you need to be aware that
they are implemented using Unix groups, which are only just adequate for
the task.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use homespace as an example—workspace is similar. Suppose you are
project <em>t01</em>. To start with, one Unix group will be assigned to this
project. The homespace directories for all users will be in directory
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/t01/t01/</span></code> —this is where the general group is held. User
<em>john</em>, for example, will have directory <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/t01/t01/john/</span></code> as his
homespace directory. (In fact, if this is the first project he joined,
that&#8217;s where he will log in.) Any file created in any of the
directoriesunder <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/t01/t01/</span></code> will belong to the Unix group for
project <em>t01</em>.</p>
<p>If you create a project group <em>t01-a</em> with no homespace quota, this will
not change. But the moment you give a homespace quota to this project
group, a Unix group will be assigned to it and a directory will be
created for it: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/t01/t01-a/</span></code> . If user <em>john</em> is a member of
this project group, he will have a directory <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/t01/t01-a/john/</span></code> .
Any files he creates under that directory will belong to <em>t01-a</em> and
will be counted against its quota.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>john</em> is still a member of the general project group, so he
can still create files there. If he belongs to other project groups
which have quotas, he&#8217;ll have directories for these as well. He can only
create files in the project groups he is a member of, since he can&#8217;t
access the directories of the other groups. It&#8217;s up to him to make sure
that he creates his files in the right places, so that they get charged
to the right project groups.</p>
<p>You should also note that once you have instituted project group quotas,
there&#8217;s no easy way back. Removing them and reassigning all the files to
other groups is a complex job and will require special arrangement with
the system team—send a request to the
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;epcc&#46;ed&#46;ac&#46;uk">helpdesk</a> if you need to do this.</p>
<p>Most projects in fact use their project groups only for administering
time, and allow their users to have access to all their space. You could
if you wish make use of <a class="reference external" href="#persquota">user quotas</a> to stop individual
users from taking too much space.</p>
<p>[Note that the above points do not apply to the reserve quotas, since
they don&#8217;t exist on the service machine. They&#8217;re just a book-keeping
fiction, and using them is cost free. We recommend this to any project
which is concerned about running out of space.]</p>

<p>First, read the <a class="reference external" href="#space">discussion of space administration</a>. If you
are still determined to use project group quotas, this is how.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<li>Click <em>Manage Project Resources</em></li>
<li>In the <em>Group Quotas</em> section, click on <em>Archive</em>, <em>Home</em> or <em>Work</em>
depending on which kind of quota you wish to create</li>
<li>You will now see a list of your project groups, including the general

note <em>No quota set</em></li>

<li>Fill in the number of Gb to move in the box</li>
<li>Click <em>Submit Group Allocation Changes</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Do not forget the final step, or nothing will happen. The act of moving
quota space to a project group which has no quota set converts that
project group to one with a group quota, administered by a Unix group,
as discussed <a class="reference external" href="#space">earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Quota changes are actually carried out by a human being. Once this has
been done, you will receive an email informing you. If you ask for the
quota to be reduced below the current size of the files in the project
group, the human will reject your request, and you will get an email
saying this.</p>

<p>User disk quotas are completely separate from project group quotas. A
user quota simply places a limit on the amount of space which a
particular user can occupy in workspace or homespace. There&#8217;s nothing to
