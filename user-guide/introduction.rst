Useful terminology
------------------

This is a list of terminology used throughout this guide and its
meaning.

kAU
    Cirrus CPU time is measured in kAU. Each job you run on the service
    consumes kAUs from your budget. You can find out more about kAUs and
    how to track your usage in the :doc:`resource_management`
