## When will I be able to access Cirrus EX4000?

We anticipate that users will have access sometime in 8-10 December 2025 but this 
date is subject to change based on progress with setting up the new system. We will
update the date on these pages and in emails to all users.

## Has my project been migrated to Cirrus EX4000?

If you have an active Cirrus CPU allocation beyond 31 Dec 2025
then your project will very likely be migrated to Cirrus EX4000. If your project
is migrated to Cirrus EX4000 then it will have the same project code as it had
on old Cirrus.

If your project has been migrated to Cirrus EX4000 then you will
be able to see this on the Project page in SAFE. In particular, you
will have a button labelled "Manage Group Time Allocations for CirrusEX (Allocations on Cirrus (2025 refresh))"
in the "Time Budgets" section on the project page.

## How much resource will my project have on Cirrus EX4000?

As on the old Cirrus CPU partition, the unit of allocation on Cirrus EX4000
is core hours (coreh). Your initial allocations on Cirrus EX4000 will have the 
same number of coreh as old Cirrus allocations.

## How do I set up an ARCHER2 account?

Once you have been notified that you can go ahead and setup a Cirrus EX4000
account you will do this through SAFE. The URL for SAFE is:

   - [https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk)

Once you have logged into SAFE, you will need to complete the following
steps before you can log into Cirrus Ex4000 for the first time:

   1. Add Cirrus EX4000 access to your current Cirrus account
   2. (Optional) Create a new SSH key pair and add it to your ARCHER2 account in SAFE
      1. See: [SSH key pairs (ARCHER2 documentation)](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/connecting/#ssh-key-pairs)
      2. If you do not add a new SSH key to your Cirrus EX4000 account, then
         your account will use the same key as your old Cirrus account

## How do I log into Cirrus EX4000 for the first time?

You will log into Cirrus EX4000 in the same way as you logged in to old Cirrus
using SSH to access `login.cirrus.ac.uk` using an SSH key pair and TOTP. Your
TOTP will be the same as it was on old Cirrus. If you have issues, the Cirrus documentation
covers logging from a variety of operating systems along with troubleshooting tips:
