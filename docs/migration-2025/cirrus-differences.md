# Main differences on Cirrus EX4000

This section provides an overview of the main differences between
the current Cirrus system and Cirrus EX4000 along with links to more
information where appropriate. It will be udated with more information
as it becomes available.

## Hardware

- There are **no** GPU nodes on Cirrus EX4000
- There are 288 cores on a Cirrus EX4000 compute node rather than 36 on current Cirrus

## Software

- The software environment will completely change to be based on the
  HPE Cray Programming Environment - no modules that were available
  on old Cirrus system will be available in the same wat on the new Cirrus
  system. We will update the documentation to cover these changes in 
  detail ahead of the switch between systems.

## Slurm scheduler configuration

- Many of the partitions and QoS will be similar between the two systems
  but limits will change. These will be documented in more detail ahead of 
  the switch.
