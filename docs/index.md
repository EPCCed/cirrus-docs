# Cirrus

Cirrus is a HPC and data science service hosted and run by
[EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) at [The University of
Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk). It is one of the
[EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk) Tier-2 National HPC Services.

Cirrus is available to industry and academic researchers. For
information on how to get access to the system please see the [Cirrus
website](http://www.cirrus.ac.uk).

The Cirrus service is an HPE Cray EX4000 CPU-based system. There are
192 standard compute nodes with 768 GB per node DDR5 memory and 64
high memory nodes with 1,536 GB per node. All compute nodes have dual AMD
EPYC 9825 processors with 144 physical cores each (288 physical
cores per node). In total the system has 256 compute nodes with
72,728 cores. Nodes are connected by a high-performance Slingshot 11 network.

This documentation covers:

- Cirrus User Guide: general information on how to use Cirrus
- Software Applications: notes on using specific software applications
  on Cirrus
- Software Libraries: notes on compiling against specific libraries on
  Cirrus. Most libraries work *as expected* so no additional notes are
  required however a small number require specific documentation
- Software Tools: Information on using tools such as debuggers and
  profilers on Cirrus

Information on using the SAFE web interface for managing and reporting
on your usage on Cirrus can be found on the [Tier-2 SAFE
Documentation](http://tier2-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This documentation draws on the
documentation for the [ARCHER2 National Supercomputing
Service](http://docs.archer2.ac.uk).
