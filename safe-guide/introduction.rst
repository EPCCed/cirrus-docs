Cirrus SAFE Overview
====================

The SAFE is a web-based application that is used for:

* Administering Cirrus user accounts
* Managing account a project resources (kAU, disk quotas, etc.)
* Reporting on usage of the system
* Helpdesk and support

Cirrus SAFE for individual users
--------------------------------

All Cirrus users have accounts on the Cirrus SAFE through which they can
view the resources they have access to, administer their account,
query their usage of the service, and submit support requests.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-users` chapter.

Cirrus SAFE for project leaders
-------------------------------

Project leaders (PI's and any designated project managers) can also
use the SAFE to approve requests to join the project, manage their
project resources on Cirrus, and generate reports on the project 
usage on Cirrus.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-pi` chapter.
