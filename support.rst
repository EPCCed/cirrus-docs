EPCC Helpdesk
=============

The EPCC Helpdesk is the first point of contact for all questions
relating to the Cirrus Service. **Support is available Monday to Friday
from 08:30 until 18:00, excluding UK public holidays.** The EPCC
Helpdesk can be reached by:

-  Email epcc-support@epcc.ed.ac.uk
-  via EPCC SAFE https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/safadmin/
-  phone: +44 (0)131 650 5000
-  By post, to:

       | EPCC Helpdesk
       | EPCC
       | James Clerk Maxwell Building
       | Peter Guthrie Tait Road
       | EDINBURGH EH9 3FD

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as
this will speed up the processing time considerably. Existing Cirrus
users will be asked for their user ID, project code, and, where
applicable, the commands they are using and the error message they get.

How the helpdesk ticket system works
------------------------------------

When a query is submitted by email or through the SAFE, it is placed in
the SAFE query system. Phone queries are entered into the system by the
helpdesk operator.

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic
acknowledgment by email, including a tracking ID, within a few minutes.
If you submit your query through SAFE, it will give you a tracking ID at
once. A few minutes later, your query will be assigned to the
appropriate expert within the Cirrus team to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra
information. Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query
will be closed. At this point the helpdesk will send you another
message, telling you that this has happened.

Closed queries are kept in the SAFE database, so that we can refer back
to them when solving future problems, and when writing documentation,
etc. The SAFE database is protected by the Cirrus Personal Data and
Privacy Policy.
