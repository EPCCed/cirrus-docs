CASTEP
======

`CASTEP <http://www.castep.org>`__  is a leading code for calculating the
properties of materials from first principles. Using density functional theory,
it can simulate a wide range of properties of materials proprieties including
energetics, structure at the atomic level, vibrational properties, electronic
response properties etc. In particular it has a wide range of spectroscopic
features that link directly to experiment, such as infra-red and Raman
spectroscopies, NMR, and core level spectra.

Using CASTEP on Cirrus
----------------------

**CASTEP is only available to users who have a valid CASTEP licence.**

If you have a CASTEP licence and wish to have access to CASTEP on Cirrus
please `submit a request through the SAFE <https://tier2-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/safe-guide-users.html#how-to-request-access-to-a-package-group>`__.

.. note:: CASTEP versions 19 and above require a separate licence from CASTEP versions 18 and below so these are treated as two separate access requests.

Running parallel CASTEP jobs
----------------------------

CASTEP can exploit multiple nodes on Cirrus and will generally be run in
exclusive mode over more than one node.

For example, the following script will run a CASTEP job using 4 nodes
(144 cores).

::

   #!/bin/bash
   
    # Slurm job options (name, compute nodes, job time)
    #SBATCH --job-name=CASTEP_Example
    #SBATCH --time=1:0:0
    #SBATCH --exclusive
    #SBATCH --nodes=4
    #SBATCH --tasks-per-node=36
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
   
   # Replace [budget code] below with your project code (e.g. t01)
   #SBATCH --account=[budget code]
   # Replace [partition name] below with your partition name (e.g. standard,gpu-skylake)
   #SBATCH --partition=[partition name]
   # Replace [qos name] below with your qos name (e.g. standard,long,gpu)
   #SBATCH --qos=[qos name]
   
   # Load CASTEP version 18 module
   module load castep/18

   # Set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 to avoid unintentional threading
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

   # Run using input in test_calc.in
   srun castep.mpi test_calc
