| :doc:`altair_hw` | HyperWorks includes best-in-class modeling,     |
|                  | linear and nonlinear analyses, structural and   |
|                  | system-level optimization, fluid and multi-body |
|                  | dynamics simulation, electromagnetic            |
|                  | compatibility (EMC), multiphysics analysis,     |
|                  | model-based development, and data management    |
|                  | solutions.                                      |
