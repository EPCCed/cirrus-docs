Service Policies
================

These policies form an integrated whole, based on the Terms and
Conditions of Access. They lay down both what we expect from Users, and
how we will carry out the commitments we make to them in the Terms and
Conditions.

In addition, Cirrus access also falls within the remit of the 
Computing Regulations and Security Policy of the University of
Edinburgh and all users who sign up for a SAFE and/or Cirrus 
account agree to these conditions of access:
