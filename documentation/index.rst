`SAFE <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/safadmin/>`__ is an online service
management system. Through SAFE, individual users can request Curris
accounts, reset passwords, see available resources and track their
usage. All users must be registered on SAFE before they can apply for
their machine account. `Go to the SAFE guide for individual
users <safe-guide/safe-guide-users.html>`__

Principal investigators and Project Managers (nominated by PIs) have
overall authority over their allocated resources and can perform
additional project management tasks in SAFE. `Go to the SAFE Guide for
principal investigators <safe-guide/safe-guide-pi.html>`__.
